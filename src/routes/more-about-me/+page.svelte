				My name is Rijad, as you already know. I'm from Austria, Vienna and I fullfilled my dream of
				becoming a self-employed, dedicated webdesigner, software engineer and blockchain developer!
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy working with passionate people that want to make a difference and deliver an
				excellent service or a great product. I stand firmly for being honest and meeting people on
				eye level, and it's the guiding star for how I approach both my personal and professional
				life.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not working on my business or coding, I'm studying at university, taking a long
				walk along the Donau or enjoying a nice Wiener Melange with friends. I also enjoy cooking
				and trying new recipes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Want to chat about Web2/Web3 or interested in a potential collaboration? Drop me a line -
				I'm always open to new connections and opportunities!
